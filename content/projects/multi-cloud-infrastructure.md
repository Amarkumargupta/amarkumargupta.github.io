# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure

## Overview
A resilient multi-cloud infrastructure implementation spanning AWS and GCP with automatic failover capabilities and distributed systems architecture.

## Technologies
- AWS
- GCP
- Terraform
- Consul

## Features
- Cross-cloud load balancing
- Automatic failover
- Distributed state management
- Real-time monitoring
- Cost optimization

## Implementation Details
The infrastructure leverages multiple cloud providers to ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.

### Cloud Configuration
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider "google" {
  project = "multi-cloud-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

module "vpc_peering" {
  source = "./modules/vpc-peering"
  aws_vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  gcp_vpc_id = google_compute_network.main.id
}
```

### Service Discovery
```hcl
resource "consul_service" "web" {
  name = "web-service"
  node = consul_node.web.name
  port = 8080
  
  check {
    name     = "HTTP API on port 8080"
    http     = "http://localhost:8080/health"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "5s"
  }
}
```

## Results
- 99.99% uptime achieved
- 45% cost reduction through optimization
- Sub-second failover time
- Global service availability
